{"post": "The ONECPP team, Production and Maintenance from Goonyella CPP1 and Riverside CPP2 have come together to launch their joint L2 MOP Board!\n\nWith the 4 teams from 2 Prep Plants coming together as one and through strong collaboration, the first dry run of their L2 MOP was completed on Thursday 16th July. The dry run was led by Franks, Murray - Processing Superintendent and Booyens, Johan - Fixed Plant Maintenance Superintendent with high levels of engagement and ownership from the Supervisors and Process Engineers from both plants.\n\nThis is the first face to face meeting for all 4 teams since Covid19 with good social distancing in place. During the E&A phase, Field Observations and S90 project it was identified that the Supervisors are unable to get into the field/work areas until mid-morning.\n\nOne of the challenges was their existing team meeting was held daily at 7:30am. The L2 MOP replaced this meeting and has been moved to 11:30am to ensure Supervisors get into the field early in their shift.\n\nA great session and well done to all involved!\n\n#2getheronecpp #bosinaction #visualisingandmanagingperformance #empowerourpeople #persueperfection\n\ncc: Cotter, Warren, Taylor, Hannah, McDonald, Kevin, Ney, Geoffrey, Brady, Shaun, Bacon, Gregory, Ranjan, Shwetank, Gee, Brent, Peri, Matt, Gray, Stewart, Hahn, Alexandra, Doran, Scott, Lines, Matt, Hegarty, Iain, Hanning, Sarah", "response": "Hedley, Jemma, I visited this L2 performance meeting last week. Coming from the previous role here at GRM as one of the Processing Superintendents, seeing the difference this has made is outstanding. The inclusive language used between both Maintenance and Operations was superb, the use of BOS practices to identify and seek understanding was also another highlight.\nIt has opened up the door to so many possibilities for the two plants and 4 teams as they work as one team to deliver value to the GRM operation.\n\nWell done to all involved. #bosinaction #2getheronecpp"}
{"post": "WAIO Rail Communication Team in conjunction with Motorola Solutions Australia have been working hard on a concept project called \u201cTech Down Solution\u201d. This project has been able to provide a solution to Rail Infrastructure & Rail Communication Personnel working alone. The concept has provided the capacity for Hand-Held Radio\u2019s to be motion monitored and in case of an medical event an emergency distress alarm automatically is sent to the Network Operation Centre in Nelson Point where the appropriate emergency response can be sent. The concept also provides a GPS location on a tracking map, with the location of the distress team member.\n\nCurrently the concept is live and evaluation in 4 months will occur to see the sustainability of the concept.", "response": "The WAIO P25 Tech Down Solution is now in production phase. The P25 Tech Down Solution can be used by any WAIO P25 Port & Rail User.\n\nCurrently the innovation is being used by the Rail Infrastrucutre Signals & Communications Team.\n\nIf you are interested in using the system or the innovation, please contact the Rail Communications Team.\n\nI have attached a video for deomonstration reference.\n\nWell Done and thank you to Rail Projects, Motorola Solutions Australia & The Rail Communication Team during all phases of the project."}

Great to see the ONECPP team #2getheronecpp embracing the MIP process as one to unlock the potential the teams can bring to the table."}

The knock on effect lead into Day 2.\n\nDay 2. This enabled Fatigue Management Training Delivery, and Tyre Awareness Training to be completed without having to leave the camp confines, in addition the extra time gained back has enabled the inductees to complete their on site WAF and commencement of Surface Mobile Equipment sign offs within the first 2 days.\n\nThis removed any requirement for buses to move people to and from Moranbah some 30 minutes away, removed costs of transport, removed lost time.\n\nCreating a better experience all round for our teams\n\nOsborne, Sussanah Scott, Dean\n\n#connected, #performance https://media.tenor.com/images/b7df9f7e9793d8855ec415b90deb5cc0/tenor.gif", "response": "Awesome Work!!!
